# 👋🏾 What's Up, I'm Keith

I’m a DevSecOps learner and career switcher from South Philadelphia — built from grit, real-world experience, and a deep commitment to growth.

Before tech, I spent 8 years in the trucking and logistics industry as a CDL-A driver, entrepreneur, and business owner. I’ve navigated long highways, tight deadlines, and real-life obstacles — including mental health, incarceration and starting over from scratch. Now, I’m using that same grit to navigate the world of tech.

## 🚀 What I’m Learning:
- 🔐 DevSecOps principles & mindset
- ☁️ Cloud (AWS, Linux, infrastructure)
- 🔁 CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- ⚙️ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, YAML)
- 🛠️ Security tools & automation

---

## 🎯 My Mission:
To document my journey in public, share what I learn, and create a blueprint for people from non-traditional paths — especially those who’ve been counted out. If you're trying to get into tech without a degree, without connections, or after setbacks — you're not alone.
